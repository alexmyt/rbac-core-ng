To have a better idea of how this works, you can check my Bachelor's project presentation about XACML
[here](http://helios.av.it.pt/attachments/download/559/_en_XACML.PAPOX.Presentation.pdf) (english),
or [here](http://helios.av.it.pt/attachments/download/557/_pt_XACML.PAPOX.Presentation.pdf) (portuguese).

Even though this plugin doesn't implement the XACML specification, it was based on its policies.
